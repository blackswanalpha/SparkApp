Sure, I'll provide a README and a LICENSE file. The README will explain the project and the usage of the FileEditor application, and the LICENSE will be a standard MIT License.

# FileEditor

## Overview
FileEditor is a desktop application built using PyQt6 that provides a file editor interface. It allows users to navigate the file system, view and edit text files, and manage quick action cards for common tasks. Quick action cards are stored in a SQLite database and can be created, edited, and deleted within the application.

## Features
- **File System Navigation**: Browse and open files from your file system.
- **Text Editor**: Edit text files with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Quick Action Cards**: Create, read, update, and delete quick action cards for common tasks.
- **SQLite Integration**: Cards are stored in an SQLite database for persistence.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt6

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FileEditor.git
   cd FileEditor
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install PyQt6
   ```

3. Run the application:

## Usage

### Navigating the File System
